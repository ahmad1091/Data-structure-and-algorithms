    "# 636. Exclusive Time of Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "On a **single-threaded** CPU, we execute a program containing `n` functions. Each function has a unique ID between `0` and `n-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function calls are **stored in** a [call stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack): when a function call starts, its ID is pushed onto the stack, and when a function call ends, its ID is popped off the stack. The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is **the current function being executed**. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents the `ith` log message formatted as a string `\"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\"`. For example, `\"0:start:3\"` means a function call with function ID `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`, and `\"1:end:2\"` means a function call with function ID `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`. Note that a function can be called **multiple times, possibly recursively**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function's **exclusive time** is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for `2` time units and another call executing for `1` time unit, the **exclusive time** is` 2 + 1 = 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the **exclusive time** of each function in an array, where the value at the ith index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.\n",
