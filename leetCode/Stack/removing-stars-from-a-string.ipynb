    "# 2390. Removing Stars From a String\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In one operation, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a star in `s`.\n",
    "- Remove the closest **non-star** character to its **left**, as well as remove the star itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the string after all stars have been removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.\n",
    "- It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"leet**cod*e\"\n",
    "Output: \"lecoe\"\n",
    "Explanation: Performing the removals from left to right:\n",
    "- The closest character to the 1st star is 't' in \"leet**cod*e\". s becomes \"lee*cod*e\".\n",
    "- The closest character to the 2nd star is 'e' in \"lee*cod*e\". s becomes \"lecod*e\".\n",
    "- The closest character to the 3rd star is 'd' in \"lecod*e\". s becomes \"lecoe\".\n",
    "There are no more stars, so we return \"lecoe\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"erase*****\"\n",
    "Output: \"\"\n",
    "Explanation: The entire string is removed, so we return an empty string.\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`1 <= s.length <= 105`\n",
    "- `s` consists of lowercase English letters and stars `*`.\n",
    "- The operation above can be performed on `s`."
