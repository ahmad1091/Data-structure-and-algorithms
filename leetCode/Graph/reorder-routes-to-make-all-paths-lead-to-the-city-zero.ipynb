    "# 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `n` cities numbered from 0 to `n - 1` and `n - 1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.\n",
