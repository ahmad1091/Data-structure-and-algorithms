    "# 851. Loud and Rich\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a group of `n` people labeled from `0` to `n - 1` where each person has a different amount of money and a different level of quietness.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array `richer` where `richer[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that `ai` has more money than `bi` and an integer array `quiet` where `quiet[i]` is the quietness of the `ith` person. All the given data in richer are **logically correct** (i.e., the data will not lead you to a situation where `x` is richer than `y` and `y` is richer than `x` at the same time).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an integer array `answer` where `answer[x] = y` if `y` is the least quiet person (that is, the person `y` with the smallest value of `quiet[y]`) among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than the person `x`.\n",

    "Explanation: \n",
    "answer[0] = 5.\n",
    "Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.\n",
    "The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but it is not clear if they have more money than person 0.\n",
    "answer[7] = 7.\n",
    "Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7 (which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7.\n",
    "The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",

    "- All the pairs of `richer` are **unique**.\n",
