    "# 841. Keys and Rooms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `n` rooms labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and all the rooms are locked except for room `0`. Your goal is to visit all the rooms. However, you cannot enter a locked room without having its key.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you visit a room, you may find a set of distinct keys in it. Each key has a number on it, denoting which room it unlocks, and you can take all of them with you to unlock the other rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array `rooms` where `rooms[i]` is the set of keys that you can obtain if you visited room `i`, return `true` if you can visit all the rooms, or `false` otherwise.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: rooms = [[1],[2],[3],[]]\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "We visit room 0 and pick up key 1.\n",
    "We then visit room 1 and pick up key 2.\n",
    "We then visit room 2 and pick up key 3.\n",
    "We then visit room 3.\n",
    "Since we were able to visit every room, we return true.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Input: rooms = [[1,3],[3,0,1],[2],[0]]\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: We can not enter room number 2 since the only key that unlocks it is in that room.\n",
