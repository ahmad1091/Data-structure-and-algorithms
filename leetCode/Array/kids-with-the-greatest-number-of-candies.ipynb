    "# 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies\n",
    "\n",
    "There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of `candies` the `ith` kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving the `ith` kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the `greatest` number of candies among all the kids, or `false` otherwise.\n",
