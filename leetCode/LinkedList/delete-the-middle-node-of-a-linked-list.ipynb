    "# 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List\n",

    "You are given the `head` of a linked list. **Delete** the **middle node**, and return the `head` of the modified linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **middle node** of a linked list of size `n` is the `⌊n / 2⌋th` node from the **start** using **0-based indexing**, where `⌊x⌋` denotes the largest integer less than or equal to `x`.\n",
