    "# 648. Replace Words\n",
    "\n",
    "In English, we have a concept called **root**, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word **successor**. For example, when the **root** `\"an\"` is followed by the **successor** word `\"other\"`, we can form a new word `\"another\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a `dictionary` consisting of many **roots** and a `sentence` consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the **successor**s in the `sentence` with the **root** forming it. If a **successor** can be replaced by more than one **root**, replace it with the **root** that has **the shortest length**.\n",

    "Return the `sentence` after the replacement.\n",
