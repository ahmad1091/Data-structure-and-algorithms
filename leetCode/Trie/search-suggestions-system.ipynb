    "# 1268. Search Suggestions System\n",

    "You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Design a system that suggests at most three product names from products after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix return the three lexicographically minimums products.\n",

    "Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: products = [\"mobile\",\"mouse\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\",\"mousepad\"], searchWord = \"mouse\"\n",
    "Output: [[\"mobile\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\"],[\"mobile\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\"],[\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"],[\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"],[\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"]]\n",
    "Explanation: products sorted lexicographically = [\"mobile\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\",\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"].\n",
    "After typing m and mo all products match and we show user [\"mobile\",\"moneypot\",\"monitor\"].\n",
    "After typing mou, mous and mouse the system suggests [\"mouse\",\"mousepad\"].\n",

    "Explanation: The only word \"havana\" will be always suggested while typing the search word.\n",
