    "Suppose LeetCode will start its **IPO** soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the **IPO**. Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most `k` distinct projects before the **IPO**. Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most `k` distinct projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given `n` projects where the `ith` project has a pure profit `profits[i]` and a minimum capital of `capital[i]` is needed to start it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, you have `w` capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the profit will be added to your total capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick a list of at **most** `k` distinct projects from given projects to **maximize your final capital**, and return the final maximized capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: k = 2, w = 0, profits = [1,2,3], capital = [0,1,1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**: Since your initial capital is 0, you can only start the project indexed 0.\n",
    "After finishing it you will obtain profit 1 and your capital becomes 1.\n",
    "With capital 1, you can either start the project indexed 1 or the project indexed 2.\n",
    "Since you can choose at most 2 projects, you need to finish the project indexed 2 to get the maximum capital.\n",
    "Therefore, output the final maximized capital, which is 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.\n",
