    "# 2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of hiring the ith worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are also given two integers `k` and `candidates`. We want to hire exactly `k` workers according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will run `k` sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.\n",
    "- In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first `candidates` workers or the last `candidates` workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.\n",
    "    - For example, if `costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2`] and `candidates = 2,` then in the first hiring session, we will choose the `4th` worker because they have the lowest cost `[3,2,7,7,1,2]`.\n",
    "    - In the second hiring session, we will choose `1st` worker because they have the same lowest cost as `4th` worker but they have the smallest index `[3,2,7,7,2]`. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.\n",
    "- If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.\n",
    "- A worker can only be chosen once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return *the total cost to hire exactly* `k` workers.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: costs = [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8], k = 3, candidates = 4\n",
    "Output: 11\n",
    "Explanation: We hire 3 workers in total. The total cost is initially 0.\n",
    "- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,2,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 3. The total cost = 0 + 2 = 2.\n",
    "- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,2,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 4). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.\n",
    "- In the third hiring round we choose the worker from [17,12,10,7,11,20,8]. The lowest cost is 7 (index 3). The total cost = 4 + 7 = 11. Notice that the worker with index 3 was common in the first and last four workers.\n",
    "The total hiring cost is 11.\n",
    "```\n",

    "- In the first hiring round we choose the worker from [1,2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1, and we break the tie by the smallest index, which is 0. The total cost = 0 + 1 = 1. Notice that workers with index 1 and 2 are common in the first and last 3 workers.\n",
    "- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.\n",
    "- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.\n",
    "The total hiring cost is 4.\n",
    "``` \n",
