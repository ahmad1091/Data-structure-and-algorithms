    "# 2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies\n",
    "\n",
    "You have information about `n` different recipes. You are given a string array `recipes` and a 2D string array `ingredients`. The `ith` recipe has the name `recipes[i]`, and you can create it if you have all the needed ingredients from `ingredients[i]`. Ingredients to a recipe may need to be created from other recipes, i.e., `ingredients[i] `may contain a string that is in `recipes`.\n",
