    "> **_NOTE:_**  this is same as [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/) problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statment:** \n",
    "Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (**containing at least one number**) which has the largest sum of **non-adjacent** elements, and return its **sum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** `4` \n",
    "**Explanation:** `The optimal solution is to pick elements 1 and 3, which are` \n",
    "\n",
    "`non-adjacent, with a sum of 4.`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Company:** This question is often associated with interviews at ***Apple***.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data structure and coding pattern used:** \n",
    "The Maximum Sum of Non-adjacent Elements problem can be efficiently solved using Dynamic Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize two variables, `prev_sum` and `curr_sum`, to store the previous maximum sum and current maximum sum, respectively.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the input array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Calculate the new maximum sum by adding the current element and the previous maximum sum.\n",
    "    - Update the previous maximum sum to be the maximum of the previous and current maximum sums.\n",
    "    - Update the current maximum sum to be the new maximum sum.\n",

    "    \n",
    "3. Return the maximum of the previous and current maximum sums."
