# 518. Coin Change II

# You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

# Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.

# You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

# The answer is guaranteed to fit into a signed 32-bit integer.

class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
        dp [0] = 0
        for a in range(1, amount + 1):
            for c in coins:
                if a - c >= 0:
                    dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a - c])

        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != amount + 1 else -1
