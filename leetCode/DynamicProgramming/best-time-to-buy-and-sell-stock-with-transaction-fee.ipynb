    "# 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer fee representing a transaction `fee`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.\n",

    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).\n",
    "- The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.\n",

    "Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:\n",
    "- Buying at prices[0] = 1\n",
    "- Selling at prices[3] = 8\n",
    "- Buying at prices[4] = 4\n",
