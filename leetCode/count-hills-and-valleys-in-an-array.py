# 2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array

# You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. An index i is part of a hill in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are smaller than nums[i]. Similarly, an index i is part of a valley in nums if the closest non-equal neighbors of i are larger than nums[i]. Adjacent indices i and j are part of the same hill or valley if nums[i] == nums[j].

# Note that for an index to be part of a hill or valley, it must have a non-equal neighbor on both the left and right of the index.

# Return the number of hills and valleys in nums.

class Solution:
    def countHillValley(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        arr = [nums[0]]
        for v in nums[1:]:
            if v != arr[-1]:
                arr.append(v)

        count = 0
        for i in range(1, len(arr)-1):
            if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) == (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        return count
