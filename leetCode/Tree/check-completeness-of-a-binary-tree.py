# 958. Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

# Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

# In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isCompleteTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        q = deque([root])

        while q:
            node = q.popleft()
            if not node:
                break
            q.append(node.left)
            q.append(node.right)
