    "# 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0's` to `1's `and all the `1's `to `0's` in its binary representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, The integer `5` is `\"101\"` in binary and its **complement** is `\"010\"` which is the integer `2`.\n",
    "Given an integer `n`, return its complement.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 5\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: 5 is \"101\" in binary, with complement \"010\" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.\n",

    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: n = 7\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: 7 is \"111\" in binary, with complement \"000\" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.\n",
