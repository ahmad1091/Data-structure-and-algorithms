    "# 973. K Closest Points to Origin\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2`).\n",

    "The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).\n",
