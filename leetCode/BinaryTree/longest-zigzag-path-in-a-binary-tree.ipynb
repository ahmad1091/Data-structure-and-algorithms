    "# 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree\n",

    "You are given the `root` of a binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).\n",
    "- If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move to the left child.\n",
    "- Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.\n",
    "- Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the longest **ZigZag** path contained in that tree.\n",
