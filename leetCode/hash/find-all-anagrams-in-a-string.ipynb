    "# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer **in any order**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"cbaebabacd\", p = \"abc\"\n",
    "Output: [0,6]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The substring with start index = 0 is \"cba\", which is an anagram of \"abc\".\n",
    "The substring with start index = 6 is \"bac\", which is an anagram of \"abc\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"abab\", p = \"ab\"\n",
    "Output: [0,1,2]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The substring with start index = 0 is \"ab\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\n",
    "The substring with start index = 1 is \"ba\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\n",
    "The substring with start index = 2 is \"ab\", which is an anagram of \"ab\".\n",
    " ```\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104`\n",
    "- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters."
