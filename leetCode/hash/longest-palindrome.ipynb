    "# 409. Longest Palindrome\n",

    "Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return the length of the **longest palindrome** that can be built with those letters.\n",

    "Letters are case sensitive, for example, `\"Aa\"` is not considered a palindrome here.\n",

    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"abccccdd\"\n",
    "Output: 7\n",
    "Explanation: One longest palindrome that can be built is \"dccaccd\", whose length is 7.\n",

    "- `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only."
