    "# 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close\n",
    "\n",
    "Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operation 1: Swap any two **existing** characters.\n",
    "    - For example, `abcde -> aecdb`\n",
    "- Operation 2: Transform **every** occurrence of one **existing** character into another **existing** character, and do the same with the other character.\n",
    "    - For example, `aacabb -> bbcbaa` (all `a`'s turn into `b`'s, and all `b`'s turn into `a`'s)\n",
    "You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two strings, `word1` and `word2`, return `true` if `word1` and `word2` are **close**, and `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: word1 = \"abc\", word2 = \"bca\"\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.\n",
    "Apply Operation 1: \"abc\" -> \"acb\"\n",
    "Apply Operation 1: \"acb\" -> \"bca\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: word1 = \"a\", word2 = \"aa\"\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: word1 = \"cabbba\", word2 = \"abbccc\"\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.\n",
    "Apply Operation 1: \"cabbba\" -> \"caabbb\"\n",
    "Apply Operation 2: \"caabbb\" -> \"baaccc\"\n",
    "Apply Operation 2: \"baaccc\" -> \"abbccc\"\n",
    " ```\n",
    " ---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 105`\n",
    "- `word1` and `word2` contain only lowercase English letters."
