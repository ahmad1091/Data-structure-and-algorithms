# 727. Minimum Window Subsequence

# Given strings s1 and s2, return the minimum contiguous substring part of s1, so that s2 is a subsequence of the part.

# If there is no such window in s1 that covers all characters in s2, return the empty string "". If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.
