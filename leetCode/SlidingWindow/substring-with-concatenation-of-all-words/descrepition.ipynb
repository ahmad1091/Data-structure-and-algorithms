    "# 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings of `words` are of **the same length**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **concatenated substring** in `s` is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of `words` concatenated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, if `words = [\"ab\",\"cd\",\"ef\"]`, then \"abcdef\", `\"abefcd\"`, `\"cdabef\"`, `\"cdefab\"`, `\"efabcd\"`, and `\"efcdab\"` are all concatenated strings. `\"acdbef\"` is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of `words`.\n",
    "Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in `s`. You can return the answer in **any order**.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"barfoothefoobarman\", words = [\"foo\",\"bar\"]\n",
    "Output: [0,9]\n",
    "Explanation: Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.\n",
    "The substring starting at 0 is \"barfoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\",\"foo\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "The substring starting at 9 is \"foobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\",\"bar\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"wordgoodgoodgoodbestword\", words = [\"word\",\"good\",\"best\",\"word\"]\n",
    "Output: []\n",
    "Explanation: Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.\n",
    "There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.\n",
    "We return an empty array.\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: s = \"barfoofoobarthefoobarman\", words = [\"bar\",\"foo\",\"the\"]\n",
    "Output: [6,9,12]\n",
    "Explanation: Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.\n",
    "The substring starting at 6 is \"foobarthe\". It is the concatenation of [\"foo\",\"bar\",\"the\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "The substring starting at 9 is \"barthefoo\". It is the concatenation of [\"bar\",\"the\",\"foo\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",
    "The substring starting at 12 is \"thefoobar\". It is the concatenation of [\"the\",\"foo\",\"bar\"] which is a permutation of words.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `1 <= s.length <= 104`\n",
    "- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`\n",
    "- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`\n",
    "- `s` and `words[i]` consist of lowercase English letters."
