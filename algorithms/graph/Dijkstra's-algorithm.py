# Follow the steps below to solve the problem:

# Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in the shortest-path tree, i.e., whose minimum distance from the source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty. 
# Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. Assign the distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first. 
# While sptSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices 
# Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has a minimum distance value. 
# Include u to sptSet. 
# Then update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. 
# To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. 
# For every adjacent vertex v, if the sum of the distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value of v, then update the distance value of v. 
# Note: We use a boolean array sptSet[] to represent the set of vertices included in SPT. If a value sptSet[v] is true, then vertex v is included in SPT, otherwise not. Array dist[] is used to store the shortest distance values of all vertices.
